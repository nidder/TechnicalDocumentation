 <p>  HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript)."Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web. </p>

<p> HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as: 
  <code> <li> &lt;head&gt; </li></code>
  <code><li> &lt;title&gt;</li></code>
  <code><li> &lt;body&gt; </li> </code>
  <code> <li> &lt;header&gt;</li></code>
   <code> <li>&lt;footer&gt;</li> </code>
    <code><li> &lt;article&gt; </li> </code> </p>

<p>An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by 'and'. The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the title tag can be written as <code> &lt;Title&gt; </code>,<code> &lt; TITLE &gt;</code>, or in any other way.</p>

        <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. It is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.  
If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph  (p) element.</p>
        </section>
  
      <section class= 'main-section' id='Anatomy'>
         <header> Anatomy </header>

<p>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.
The content: This is the content of the element. </p>

<p>The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.
The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.</p>

        Nesting
           </header>
        
        <p>Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word very in a strong element, which means that the word is to have strong(er) text formatting.The tags have to open and close in a way that they are inside or outside one another. With the kind of overlap in the example above, the browser has to guess at your intent. This kind of guessing can result in unexpected results.</p>

           <header>
          Block level & inline
             </header>
          <p>There are two important categories of elements to know in HTML: block-level elements and inline elements. This section will tell you how to create them and use them in your projects.  </p>
           <img id= 'elements-image' src= 'https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*AFeOAqXNJJdfYAjfXiJ9AQ.jpeg' alt= 'Image displaying coloured blocks in the block-level style and in-line style'>

<p>Block-level elements form a visible block on a page. A block-level element appears on a new line following the content that precedes it. Any content that follows a block-level element also appears on a new line. Block-level elements are usually structural elements on the page. For example, a block-level element might represent headings, paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, or footers. A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested inside another block-level element.</p>
<p>Inline elements are contained within block-level elements, and surround only small parts of the documentâ€™s content (not entire paragraphs or groupings of content). An inline element will not cause a new line to appear in the document. It is typically used with text, for example an a <code> &lt;em&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> create emphasis.</p>

  <section class='main-section' id='Attributes'>
     <header>
   Attributes 
       </header>
    
    <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this example, the class attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with style information.</p>
        

<p>An attribute should have:

A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces too.)
The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.
An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.</p>
     </section>
  
         <section class='main-section' id='Boolean'>
            <header>
           Boolean
              </header>
            <p>Sometimes you will see attributes written without values. This is entirely acceptable. These are called Boolean attributes.  </p>

<p>Boolean attributes can only have one value, which is generally the same as the attribute name. For example, consider the disabled attribute, which you can assign to form input elements. (You use this to disable the form input elements so the user can't make entries. The disabled elements typically have a grayed-out appearance.)</p>
     </section>
         <section class='main-section' id='Comments'>
            <header>
           Comments 
              </header>
           
            <p>HTML has a mechanism to write comments in the code. Browsers ignore comments, effectively making comments invisible to the user.  
           The purpose of comments is to allow you to include notes in the code to explain your logic or coding. This is very useful if you return to a code base after being away for long enough that you don't completely remember it. Likewise, comments are invaluable as different people are making changes and updates.</p>
